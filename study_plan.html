        <!-- Personal Statement -->
        <div class="personal-statement">
            <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
            <p>Iâ€™m Maryam from Lahore, Pakistan, known as "The City of Gardens." Having recently completed my exams for the third year of high school with a focus on Computer Science, Physics, and Mathematics, I stand at the threshold of exciting opportunities in the tech world.</p>
            <p>My fascination with technology began at an early age, fueled by the transformative power of user-friendly websites, apps, and AI tools. This passion has blossomed into a commitment to become a full-fledged full-stack web developer. I am particularly drawn to AI, with the ambition to develop tools that positively impact people's lives.</p>
            <p>In my first year of high school, I engaged in Girl Guiding for five months, where I honed my teamwork, leadership, and management skills. This experience, along with my participation in various extracurricular activities, has greatly contributed to my personal growth and confidence.</p>
            <p>My coding skills flourished through the CS50: Introduction to Computer Science course offered by Harvard Online, where I completed nine problem sets and a final project. This course deepened my understanding of programming languages, web development techniques, and the crucial art of problem-solving. Learning about databases, algorithms, conditions, functions, and loops reshaped my perspective on coding, sparking an eagerness to refine my skills further.</p>
            <p>Alongside CS50, I completed courses in Web Development by SoloLearn and Effective Business Websites by HP LIFE. I applied my skills by developing a Rock-Paper-Scissors game and creating my portfolio website. Through both individual projects and group collaborations, I enhanced my teamwork capabilities, showcasing my work on my LinkedIn profile.</p>
            <p>I also volunteered with Psych.4Teens, focusing on content creation to raise public awareness about mental health. This experience underscored my belief in using technology to address societal challenges.</p>
            <p>Driven by my passion for coding, I established a social club for like-minded beginners and intermediates, emphasizing project collaborations and networking in front-end and back-end development. Balancing the management of this club with my studies and volunteering was challenging, but it significantly improved my organizational skills as I assumed roles such as vice president and manager.</p>
            <p>As I look to the future, I am eager to continue my education in Coding and AI at [University Name]. This institution stands out to me for its commitment to innovation and its strong community of aspiring tech leaders. I am particularly impressed by its curriculum and resources, which I believe will provide the ideal environment for my growth and development.</p>
            <p>In the coming years, I aim to focus on my areas of interest, including software engineering, AI, and full-stack development. Through ongoing projects and internships, I hope to further refine my coding and problem-solving skills, working on real-world applications that can make a difference.</p>
