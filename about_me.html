        <p>
            Ever since I was a child, I have been fascinated by the ever-evolving world of technology 
            and its potential to solve real-world problems. I have always been driven by the idea that
            with the right tools and mindset, technology can be used to create innovative solutions to 
            complex challenges. This passion for technology, combined with my desire to make a meaningful 
            impact on the world, is what motivates me to pursue higher education at a prestigious university.
        </p>
        <p>
            My dream is to study a dual degree in business and technology, with a focus on artificial intelligence
            and data science. I believe that understanding the intersection of business and technology will equip me 
            with the skills needed to develop solutions that can help businesses thrive in the digital age. In 
            addition, I hope to leverage this knowledge to contribute to the development of AI solutions that can
            an address critical global challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            Attending a prestigious university will provide me with access to world-class professors, resources, and
            research opportunities that will enable me to deepen my knowledge in these fields. I am eager to engage in 
            rigorous academic programs, participate in cutting-edge research projects, and learn from experts in the field.

        <h2>My Study Plan</h2>
        <p>
            My study plan is designed to prepare me for a successful career in both business and technology. 
            In the first year, I plan to take foundational courses in computer science and business to build a
            strong understanding of both fields. These courses will help me gain a deep understanding of 
            programming, algorithms, and data structures, as well as key business concepts such as management,
            marketing, and finance.
        </p>

            In subsequent years, I plan to specialize in artificial intelligence and data science. I will take advanced
            courses in machine learning, deep learning, and big data analytics, while also exploring the ethical implications 
            of AI. I also plan to gain practical experience by participating in internships and working on real-world projects
            that will allow me to apply my knowledge and skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond academics, I am committed to developing my leadership and communication skills through extracurricular 
            activities and volunteer work. I believe that these skills are essential for becoming a well-rounded professional
            who can contribute to the global tech community.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am excited to embark on this journey and look forward to the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. 
            With dedication and hard work, I am confident that I will achieve my goals and make a positive impact in the 
            world of technology.
